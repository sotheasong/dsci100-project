    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Minecraft is a sandbox, open-world video game developed by Mojang Studios where players explore, build and interact in a three-dimensional virtual world made of blocks. Players can build structures, gather resources and craft items to aid their survival, either individually or with other players in a multiplayer server (Minecraft.net, 2023). This makes it an ideal platform for studying player behaviors in a video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A research group led by Professor Frank Wood wants to assess how people play video games. To do this, they have set up a Minecraft server where players' interactions are recorded in detailed session logs. However, in doing so they face challenges such as identifying which players are most valuable to recruit and ensuring they have the resources necessary. "

    "\n",
    "1. `players.csv`\n",

    "- **age** (Integer): age\n",
    "- **gender** (Categorical): gender (Male, Female, Other)\n",
    "- **experience** (Categorical): gaming experience level (Amateur, Regular, Pro, Veteran)\n",
    "- **subscribe** (Boolean): whether the player subscribed to the game-related newsletter\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains **34** unique playesrs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `sessions.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **player_id** (String): identifier for each player\n",
    "- **start** (String): start time of the session\n",
    "- **end** (String): end time of the session\n",

    "This dataset contains **56** recorded sessions, where some of which have missing end times.\n",

    "We calculate total playtime per player (in minutes) by summing all valid session durations. This will be used as the response variable. The explanatory variables are **age**, **gender**, **experience**, and **subscribe**."
